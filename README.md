# TBT Advisory One-Page Site

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Content editing

All website copy is centralized in:

- `/Users/maxdo/Downloads/TBT Advisory New/content/content.ts`

Update this file to change text across Hero, About, Services, Process, Contact, and Imprint.

## Asset replacement

- Founder image: replace `/Users/maxdo/Downloads/TBT Advisory New/public/founder.png`
- Downloadable profile: replace `/Users/maxdo/Downloads/TBT Advisory New/public/profile.pdf`

A placeholder `profile.pdf` is included so the download link works immediately.
